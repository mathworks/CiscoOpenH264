# CiscoOpenH264
OpenH264 is a codec library which supports real time encoding and decoding video streams in H.264 format . Cisco has taken the H.264 implementation, and open sourced it under BSD license terms. They have provided a binary form suitable for inclusion in applications across a number of different operating systems, and made this binary module available for download from the Internet. To ensure that the license text is in sync with the appropriate version of the openh264 binary during download, we are hosting these binaries in the MathWorks GitHub repository.
