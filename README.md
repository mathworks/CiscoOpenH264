# CiscoOpenH264

OpenH264 is a codec library which supports H.264 encoding and decoding. See http://www.openh264.org/ for more details.

# Introduction

OpenH264 is a codec library which supports real time encoding and decoding video streams in H.264 format . Cisco has taken the H.264 implementation, and open sourced it under BSD license terms. They have provided a binary form suitable for inclusion in applications across a number of different operating systems, and made this binary module available for download from the Internet. Cisco will not pass on the MPEG-LA licensing costs for this module, and based on the current licensing environment, this will effectively make H.264 decoding free for use on supported platforms.

# License

Cisco provides the binary under the terms of a two-clause BSD license. Additionally, the binary is licensed under Ciscoâ€™s AVC/H.264 Patent Portfolio License from MPEG LA, at no cost to you, provided the requirements and conditions listed in the AVC/H.264 Patent Portfolio sections are met. Please see the full binary license text at: http://www.openh264.org/BINARY_LICENSE.txt.
